        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone has their own unique experiences and lessons learned from
          them. I had (and still have) a somewhat stubborn approach to life and
          I like to do things my way and by myself. I am currently learning the
          detriments to that approach and that myopic mindset prevents learning
          and the betterment of myself. I'm also learning the importance of
          trusting and relying on others which helps me understand and utilize
          other people's ideas and perspectives. If I continue to do things in
          soley in my particular way, then I cannot garner any useful insight
          that would be beneficial to not only me as a writer but as a person.
          Although, typically for writing assignments in school its hard to
          display and incorporate these insights without the risk of losing
          points or "getting a bad grade". Because of this, I have also learned
          how to write formulaicly and try to get the best way possible on
          assignments, such as essays on texts and supporting arguments that I
          don't believe in for those aforementioned texts. These lessons I've
          learned are mainly tied into my life experiences as any other person's
          are and its important to not minimize the experiences and perspectives
          of others.
