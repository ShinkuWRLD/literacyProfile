        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Life can often become overwhelming and chaotic once factors out of our
          control begin to occur. I've been fortunate enough to have a strong
          support system (via my family and friends) to help me through the
          tough times I did face. I've been also fortunate enough to be equipped
          to face these challenges, since my life challenges could've been much
          worse. I've used these experiences primarily to help myself grow in
          the writing sphere and gain a stronger sense of social awareness. Last
          semester, I took Honors class 115 which tied into the ideas of
          identity and sense of belonging. I used my own experiences to connect
          with the authors that we studied and gain more insight on certain
          social issues and challenges that have existed and still exist to this
          day.
