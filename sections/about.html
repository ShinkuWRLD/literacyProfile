        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is David McManus and I am a first year at CCSU studying
          Computer Science. Although I am in the STEM field, I grew up in
          households that have encouraged the cultivation of my ELA skills, such
          as writing, reading, abstract thinking, language comprehension, etc.
          Of these skills I am mostly drawn to reading dystopian novels and
          writing pieces of creative fiction. I abhor writing essays and other
          schoolastic pieces due to the repetitiveness and negative environments
          tied to the schools I attended in my youth. I aim to be literate in
          the realms of programming literacy as well as literacy pertaining to
          social networking. I'm starting to expand outside of my comfort zone
          and building friendships and acquaintances that I would otherwise
          avoid.
